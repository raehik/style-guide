Markdown style guide
--------------------

This is my style guide for Markdown. Markdown has a lot of your-choice
stuff since it's meant to be written however the person likes, but I
have some rules I subconsciously follow in order to lay things out
clearly and consistently.

  * prefer 72-column hard-wrapping
  * prefer placing reference links/footnotes just after usage
      * If a block of text from the link follows its usage, I place it
        **after** that block. Often happens when quoting from a page.
  * prefer asterisks for bulleted lists
  * prefer 2-space indent for start of list, quote
  * prefer 4-space indent for sublists
      * Other indents can mess up sometimes, or something, **I don't
        know** :(
  * prefer 2 empty lines between the end of a paragraph and a new header
  * always match the header underline to the header length
      * Just looks neat.
  * always use asterisks rather than underscores to embolden/italicise

Header - succint overview of main changes (what)

Body -- describe all *what*, plus explain why those changes were made.

Header should:
    - be <= 50 chars long
        - any more is cropped (word?) by GitHub
    - start with a capital letter
        - I always used to use no caps, but it the other way seems more
          common
    - not have any punctuation
        - uses precious chars

Body should:
    - describe all *what* in detail
    - explain as much as possible (why did the change need to be made?)
    - use proper English, mostly
        - caps, punctuation, etc. though not really as fussy in the
          body!

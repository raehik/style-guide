Header - succint overview of main changes (what)

Body -- explain why those changes were made (why) (+ any more what)

Header should:
    - be <= 50 chars long
        - any more is cropped (word?) by GitHub
    - not start with a capital letter
        - personal preference: there seems to be a split between caps or
          no caps, and I prefer the latter
    - not have any punctuation
        - uses precious chars

Body should:
    - describe all *what* in detail
    - explain as much as possible (why did the change need to be made?)
    - use proper English, mostly:
        - no capital letter
        - but yes on punctuation etc., though not as fussy as header
